# Applied Data Mining-Energy Efficiency of Buildings

## Project description
### • Used Machine learning tools to replace time consuming simulation like Ecotect to accurately predict the Energy Efficiency of Buildings (heating and cooling) .
### • Output :Heating Load, Cooling Load
### • 8 different parameters: Relative compactness, Surface area, Wall area, Roof Area, Overall Height, Orientation, Glazing Area, Glazing Area Distribution
### • Calculated Correlation between different input and output parameters so as to have an idea that how to carry further analysis
### • Machine learning tools used : Linear Regression, Regression Tree and Random Forest
### • Got Linear Regression model with goodness of fit to be 94.54%
### • Regression Tree described 70% samples using input parameters Relative Compactness, Wall Area, Glazing Area
### • Random forest gave the idea of importance of input (in descending order) as : Relative compactness, Overall Height, Surface area, Glazing Area, Wall area, Roof Area,Glazing Area Distribution, Orientation
